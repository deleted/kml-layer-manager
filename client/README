KML Layer Manager Client Library

This is a simple library for interacting with a KML Layer Manager
instance from your own client-side Python scripts.

INSTALLATION
============

To install the client library, simply run:

    python setup.py install

from this directory.  (You may need to do this with administrator
priveleges, e.g. via the "sudo" command on Unix-like systems.)
This will install two things:

    1. A Python library called "layermanager_client" that you can use
      from your own Python scripts.

    2. An executable script called "layermanager_download.py" that
      you can use to download large layers from the server in bulk
      more efficiently.

This library uses the google.appengine.tools.appengine_rpc library
that is distributed with the Google App Engine SDK.  In order for this
library to work, the App Engine SDK will need to be available on your
Python path.  It in turn depends on a number of other third-party
libraries which you may install yourself but which are also
distributed along with the App Engine SDK, so you can simply add them
to your Python path directly if you prefer.

For example, if you unpacked the SDK into /usr/local/google_appengine
then you could add these two entries to your Python path:

    /usr/local/google_appengine
    /usr/local/google_appengine/lib

The exact mechanism by which you do this is platform-dependent.

Finally, the unit tests in this directory also depend on the mox
testing library, version 0.5.2 or later, which is available here:
